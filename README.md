This package contains code for uncertainty quantification for models of ratios of count data, as well as extensions for models that are affine functions of count ratios. This code is a work in progress and will change significantly over the coming months. The model was developed with an eye for applications in the estimation of thermospheric neutral temperature from LBH data, so a lot of the terminology used will derive from that context. 

The package can be installed with the command devtolls::install_github('mfleduc/PoissonRatioUQ'). More details to come.
