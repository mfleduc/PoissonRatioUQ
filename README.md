This package contains code for uncertainty quantification for models of ratios of count data. The model was developed with an eye for applications in the estimation of thermospheric neutral temperature from LBH data, so a lot of the terminology used will derive from that context.



The package can be installed with the command devtools::install\_github('mfleduc/PoissonRatioUQ'). More details to come.
